# api_project: LAD (little alchemy demo)

##Goal:
  * Create a "little alchemy" demo that requires the user to guess what object is formed by combining two other objects. 

##Group members:
  - *[Shawn Li](https://github.com/TyranitarShawn)*
  - *[Masahero Masuda](https://github.com/Masa13)*

##To-do list:
  - Add Tumblr API (Masahero)
  - Add Alchemy dictionary (Masahero)
  - Adjust middle to get requests and process them (Shawn can't do until above two are completed)
  - Adjust front end
  - Add to Home and About page (anyone)

##Odd bugs:
 - "No json object could be decoded" occurs when working on linux computers but not windows computers.
